<h1>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="personal information txt">
    <p>Hi! I am Archei (still pronounced as Ar-chee). Small fact, the spelling of my name was a typographical
      error in my birth certificate, and my parents decided to keep it that way. I was born in the Philippines,
      and I came to Australia with my family in the year 2011 when I was 15 years old. I also speak English
      and Filipino. I am currently working as a Sterilisation Technician at the hospital. I had completed an
      advanced diploma in civil drafting before I got my qualifications as a Sterilisation Technician. During
      break times at work, I play online chess. At home, I play the guitar and play along with some music,
      and in my free time, I create my own compositions.   I'm not a big gamer, but I play Dota 2 with my
      friends whenever we are all free. I have a cat that I really have not given a proper name until now, but
      I call her Maya.

  <div class="INTERESTS">
    <h1>INTEREST IN I.T.</h1>

  <p>
    My interest in I.T started when I was in years 6 to 7. The school started a basic introduction to I.T. subject. The most exciting part of it was learning HTML. We could have gone through JavaScript, but that was taught in the following year, which I missed because we migrated to Australia. Before moving to Australia, I joined a multimedia club at school where we were taught essential computer components, assembling and disassembling computer hardware. We also had a session on video and photo editing. The project's aim was to promote the school's summer programs. This experience gave me an insight that I.T does not also involve working on computers and computer software but also collaboration and working in teams.
My uncle is also a techy and a gamer guy. He was really the first one to introduce me to the world of I.T through games (PS1), music, and file-sharing programs such as LimeWire (discontinued). I was more exposed to the hardware aspect in I.T.  until my mother also had an I.T project where she designed an online shop. Even though I had a little experience with HTML, it was an eye-opener for me because I was introduced to software and programs such as Adobe, graphics editors, VLC, etc. Today, most of my friends are in the I.T industry. Though there has been a great gap between today and my first experience in I.T., I.T.  has always been a part of my life, and thus, now I am more eager to explore and see the future of   the world of Information Technology

    <h1>IDEAL JOB</h1>
    <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2><br>
    <figure>
      <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56277267?type=standard#sol=e86e9d0815965d8fc107cee57392768e324b2d99">

      </a><br> <figcaption >click image to go to Seek..</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p> A Full Stack Developer would require a vast knowledge of programming languages because it requires expertise in both front end, which uses CSS, JavaScript and HTML,and back end development, which uses programming languages such as Python and PHP. Front end development produces the entire graphics, text, colours, navigation,  and overall design of a website, application or software enhancing the user's experience and making it appealing and flawless in the eyes of the user. On the other hand , back end  development works with the server-side of the application and uses  codes that will allow communication between the database and the application (University of Toronto n.d.).   Becoming a full stack developer would be challenging because of the various tasks and different programming languages that will be used, not to mention identifying errors and bugs, and fulfilling project requirements.
 What makes this position appealing is working in teams,  liasing with different developers and clients, keeping up to date with the progression of technology and business demands, and personally, I prefer working behind the scenes, being versatile and solving mathematical logical problems.
As a Full stack developer, completion of qualification could be from Certificate IV in Information Technology through TAFE to a bachelor degree in I.T or Computer science from universities which can be completed in three to four years. Though it is not necessary to have a formal qualification to become a Full Stack developer, employers still prefer applicants with a qualification (Seek n.d.).
<p>
Currently, I am studying to gain the essential qualification to enter the I.T industry. My current technical skills are not up to date however, soft skills are always desirable by employers. Aside from technical skills, soft skills are essential especially in I.T. because of its global scope. Example of soft skills include communication skills, teamwork, problem solving skills, intrapersonal (e.g., self-discipline.) interpersonal skills (e.g., emotional intelligence, empathy). Though tasks must be completed alone, there will always be some instances that I have to work with others. In our team, morning and afternoon huddles are good exercises to plan our days and doing handovers to the next team to perform their duties.    Our teams are composed of unique individuals from different cultures with different attitudes and customs. The application of Emotional intelligence allows us to understand others' feelings, which influences and utilises those emotions or feelings in effective communication, adapt, and use these skills to interact and build relationships that will affect the the decision-making process.
</p> <p>
Skills and knowledge in different programming language can also be acquired from third-party learning sites or online training courses. By acquiring a degree in I.T., I would be able to have the necessary technical skills and soft skills that would benefit me in the work setting. After or before graduating, I also plan on applying for a junior role, internship or a graduate program where I can use all the knowledge, I acquired from studying in the university in a practical work setting. Any skills and knowledge  I gain from minor roles will also allow me to have commercial awareness technical, critical, and decision-making skills within the I.T. field. I also plan to be employed to gain experience and external connections.

<div class="Personality Prof">
  <h1>PERSONALITY PROFILE</h1>
<h2>Myers-Briggs test</h2><br>
<img src="https://github.com/StrangeArc10/Strangebox/blob/main/mbtest.jpg" style="width:300px;height:700px">
<p>According to the results of the Myers-Briggs test, I was identified as INTP-T, a Logician personality. Our personality type is curious about how and why things work as if everything is a mystery (NERIS Analytics Limited 2022). Reading through the result seems inaccurate but also, it has pointed out some of my traits. It is puzzling to a Logician when things are Irrational and illogical and, when emotions influence an individual's attitude.   I have learnt through this test that I have to avoid holding back on taking action or holding back communication with the team when I feel or become uncertain because it is challenging to decide which would be the best way to provide support. Our personality type also leads us to overthink small things and struggle to finish tasks. Strengths include being open-minded, analytical, curious and, originality. On the other hand, weaknesses include being impatient, dissatisfied, perfectionistic, insensitive, and disconnected.   When creating a team, the result of this test would support in the delegation of tasks to every member to fairly spread workload and allow each individual to work on their strengths.</p>
</div>

<div class="Learning Style Test">
  <h2>LEARNING STYLE TEST</h2>
<p>The result of the test indicated that I have a visual learning style. This means that information is best presented and learnt through pictures, diagrams and graphs (NU Online 2020). Relating this to the result of the Myers-Briggs test is that our distinctive curiosity could lead us to this learning style. My personal experience in this is when I donâ€™t use maps when driving back home from an unfamiliar place, I would usually rely on photographic memory or remember landmarks. Visual and auditory learning style goes hand in hand during team meetings especially when discussing topics such as workflows, statistics and trends and, step by step instructions. It is also easier to remember information when taking notes on the discussion. Sitting In front of the speaker and the visual aids also help identify body language and facial expression (SOAR Learning Inc. n.d.). I would consider using visual aids in the team especially in an online environment or during presentation to help retain information as well as an entertaining graphic art can relieve tension in the room.</p>
</div>

<div class="Creativity Test">
  <h2>CREATIVITY TEST</h2>
  <img src="https://github.com/StrangeArc10/Strangebox/blob/main/creativity%20test.jpg" style="width:500px;height:300px">
<p>According to this web chart, the results indicated that I scored above the typical score (AULIVE n.d.). This means that I am fairly creative with the strengths coming from abstraction of concepts, curiosity and Paradox, which means I am able to accept and work around contradicting statements. Paradox is somehow connected to the metric Connection because it shows that an individual has the ability to connect different things that has no apparent connection. I believe that I could contribute in a lot of brainstorming session because I can throw ideas that will could get the team going. Speaking out the ideas may be daunting because some might not accept it or see it too shallow or peculiar, however I believe that it is better than not contributing at all. When forming a team, this will allow me to determine how members will approach a task. Using this kind of test when forming a team will also allow me to determine how team members will view and make use of an idea to create projects, proposals and goals and, their behaviour and attitudes towards a situation.</p>
</div>

<div class="IT Project">
  <h1>IT PROJECT</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This projectâ€™s aim is to develop an app that will enhance a small business connection to customers as well as convenient for customers. My goal is to create a website/app for a small service business that will allow their customers to book services, inquire for quotes, buy products online, allow customer feedback, a chat feature and live tracker for their booked services so that customers can manage their time and estimate when they can collect their services or orders. The website is available for a small business to target mainly their customers as well as to promote their business online.</p>
</div>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>This project will be useful to business owners and customers. The idea behind this is that there is no fixed time to when a service (car, repairs, building, restaurants etc.) will finish however, a live tracking tool can constantly update customers without the need to ring up the reception. This idea came from my own personality of being impatient, having the need of constant updates. I wanted to see the potential of this idea in the future because there are services that are already available and I would like create an app that will have the features of other apps in one. This kind of project will push me to learn more to materialise this idea. </p>
</div>

  <h2>Desciption</h2>
<p>Users can create their own account either a business or customerâ€™s account. With a business account, the shop owner can create and customise their own page using the pre-sets and layouts that are available in the application. Business owners can showcase their services and products on their page. Business accounts will have a monthly subscription to the app to maintain and improve the app in the future. Also, an additional fee can be charged to business accounts if they want a more customised design to add to their page. The subscription fee to create a business account is $30.00 per month. The customised page will have a much higher amount depending on the design they require. To get their business out in the open, there will be tags or keywords that they can attach to their profile so that customers can easily find them when customers are searching for services and products. A unique link or QR code or bar code will serve as a digital business card for business owners. This can be shared to their customers via social media, or in-shop.
The account for customers will be free as they browse through the profile of the business and check their products and services. Customers can book, order, leave a message, chat, buy products and services, leave customer feedbacks as well as bookmarking their most used and favourite shops which can be viewed by other users so that other customers can explore and try other shops that other customers visited. Customers can also post an ad if they needed any kind of services or queries, where they can book services, they need or order products or food. Other users can reply and suggest to customer queries as well as business account owners can offer their services and products when they see the tag. Customers should indicate the tag or keyword before posting their queries so that fellow users can quickly identify their queries as well as get replies that are relevant to their queries.
This website/app is not a delivery app although shop owners can opt in to use third party delivery services to accommodate customers. Another feature of this app for both business and customer accounts are that when booking for a spot, for example, booking in a restaurant, shop owners can indicate how many spots are available for booking to save customers from inquiring over the phone for reservations.  These features will potentially save both customer and ownerâ€™s users and therefore it can contribute to labour efficiency.   The idea of the app came from the idea of a pizza live tracker. Similarly, customers can track the stages of the service they hired. Also, Iâ€™ve always wanted to code an app or a website that can help the community to manage their time and release some anxiety.
The problems that I can encounter could range from funding, marketing and manpower to create a working website with various features as well as involving many clients.  The idea of the website cannot be done by one person only.
</p>


<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>Coding the website can be achieved by using programming languages, markup languages and scripting language to create the various features of the website. Examples of languages that can be used are:  HTML, Java, Python and PHP.   The live tracker or progress bar can be programmed so that this feature can be added to the website/app.  In order for me to create an application, the use of integrated development environment (IDE) will allow the codes to materialise as a functioning application. Examples of IDE include MS Visual Studio, NetBeans and Eclipse.  These IDEâ€™s can either be purchased or are free open-source editors (Arsenault 2017).</p>

<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p> Gaining the relevant skills to create a working website is a must. Technical skills and language proficiency can be acquired through university degree or even in web developing short courses.  Investing on time, effort and dedication for me to acquire all the relevant skills and the proper education are all important to achieve my goals and the potential of the website. Aside from the technical aspect, further research on the social aspect is also required for it to fit in with the communityâ€™s demands.  I can gain more experience by working with different teams and working under I.T companies where I can share my vision, ideas and work through problems and eventually, start my own project.</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>There will be so many trials and testing before this idea can materialise.  The outcome of this project is unfixed because of its many features and possibly the manpower that is required however, if given the chance to acquire all the necessities for this project, I believe that it will help small business owners to promote their services and products. There are many talented and skilled business owners and their staff that are yet to be recognised. </p>
